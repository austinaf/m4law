# McCorriston Miller Law Mock-up
###### Law Firm Landing Page Re-Vamp

Draft and mock-up of proposed re-design and re-structuring of m4law.com for ITMA

Main goals of this re-design:
1. Leverage a CMS (Wordpress/Prismic, exact CMS not yet determined) for easy site management by future m4 or ITMA members.
2. Establish a fully functional responsive design. Current site is not responsive.
3. Establish a better hiearchy of items on the main page.  Make navigation and display of current attorneys easier to navigate as well as establishing a more clear display for current news.
4. Utilize free-tiers of either Google Firebase or AWS for deployment and hosting.
